              A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a
              discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.
              Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing,
              used to organize longer prose.
